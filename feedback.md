* code should be left aligned 
* missing: Army class -20
* #311 efficiency: calls a function for every character Why not write/ call one  reusable function that converts a string into upper/lower case  -2
* #395 unnecessary wasteful function calls; sort is slow as it is, why make it even slower? 
* #503-513 – should have been a separate function that returns a string of found records-2
* #325- what for? str1>str2  works just fine -2
* #19 I would not leave strings blank,  “n/a” ; if printed, it would appear  as if “ink” is missing
